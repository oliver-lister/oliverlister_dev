# Welcome to my MDX page!

Whether you're using Redux Toolkit, Zustand, React's Context API, or any other
global state management solution for your React.js e-commerce store, the
fundamental approach to building a robust shopping cart remains consistent.

# The Setup

## Products

Building a sensible shopping cart starts with your products themselves. Products
need to have the following key features:

1. **Unique Identifier (ID)** – Each product should have a unique identifier to
   distinguish it from others in the catalog. This ID will help manage the
   products in the cart, ensuring you can correctly reference and manipulate
   each one.

2. **Name and Description** – Every product should include a name and a short
   description to help users identify what they’re purchasing. These details
   make the shopping experience clearer and more user-friendly.

3. **Price** – The product’s price must be easily accessible. This is essential
   for calculating the total cost in the cart, applying discounts, and showing
   users an accurate breakdown of their expenses. You may also wish to store
   historical price data for features such as sales.

4. **Stock** – Keeping track of stock levels is critical for ensuring the
   availability of products. Managing stock effectively allows the cart to
   display accurate product availability and prevents users from adding items
   that are out of stock.

5. **Image** – An image adds to the clarity and attractiveness of the product
   page and cart. If you're storing multiple images per product, this will be an
   array. The image is best stored as a URL.

6. **Date of Creation** - Its usually good practice to store the date when the
   product was created for use later on with filtering and sorting mechanisms.

7. **Attributes (Optional)** – Products may have attributes such as available
   sizes or colors. Allowing users to select and modify these attributes within
   the cart ensures they get the exact product they need.

In TypeScript you could type the Product object as follows:

```tsx
type size = "S" | "M" | "L" | "XL";
type color = {
  label: string;
  hex: string;
};

type Product = {
  id: number;
  name: string;
  description: string;
  price: number;
  stock: number;
  image: string;
  created_at: Date;
  attributes: {
    sizes: size[];
    colors: color[];
  };
};
```

Once the products are well-defined, the next step is to create the cart
functionality, which includes adding, updating, and removing items from the
cart.
