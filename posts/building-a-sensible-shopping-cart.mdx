Whether you're using Redux Toolkit, Zustand, React's Context API, or any other
global state management solution for your React.ts e-commerce store, the
fundamental approach to building a robust shopping cart remains the same. Make
it fool-proof, informative and **do what the user expects it to do**.

---

# The Setup

## Products

Building a sensible shopping cart starts with your products themselves. Products
need to have the following key features:

1. **Unique Identifier (ID)** – Each product should have a unique identifier to
   distinguish it from others in the catalog. This ID will help manage the
   products in the cart, ensuring you can correctly reference and manipulate
   each one.

2. **Name and Description** – Every product should include a name and a short
   description to help users identify what they’re purchasing. These details
   make the shopping experience clearer and more user-friendly.

3. **Price** – The product’s price must be easily accessible. This is essential
   for calculating the total cost in the cart, applying discounts, and showing
   users an accurate breakdown of their expenses. You may also wish to store
   historical price data for features such as sales.

4. **Stock** – Keeping track of stock levels is critical for ensuring the
   availability of products. Managing stock effectively allows the cart to
   display accurate product availability and prevents users from adding items
   that are out of stock.

5. **Image** – An image adds to the clarity and attractiveness of the product
   page and cart. If you're storing multiple images per product, this will be an
   array. The image is best stored as a URL.

6. **Date of Creation** - Its usually good practice to store the date when the
   product was created for use later on with filtering and sorting mechanisms.

7. **Attributes (Optional)** – Products may have attributes such as available
   sizes or colors. Allowing users to select and modify these attributes within
   the cart ensures they get the exact product they need.

In TypeScript you could type the Product object as follows:

```ts
// types.ts

type Size = "S" | "M" | "L" | "XL";
type Color = {
  label: string;
  hex: string;
};

type Product = {
  id: number;
  name: string;
  description: string;
  category: string;
  price: number;
  stock: number;
  image: string;
  created_at: Date;
  attributes: {
    sizes: Size[];
    colors: Color[];
  };
};
```

## Cart

Great, our Product object is now set up with all the essential fields. Next,
let’s focus on the Cart. To minimise the amount of data stored locally in state,
we'll reference the Product's ID and only retain the necessary fields:

1. **Unique Identifier (ID)** – Similar to products, cart items require a unique
   identifier to differentiate between items that share the same product ID but
   have different attributes, such as size or color.

2. **Selected Attributes** – It&apos;s essential to accurately track the user's
   selected product attributes, such as color and size, to ensure a seamless
   checkout.

3. **Quantity** – The number of items the user wants to purchase must be
   tracked. This allows the cart to accurately reflect the total cost and
   inventory levels, ensuring the correct quantity is available for checkout.

4. **Reference to the Product's ID** – Each cart item must reference the
   original product ID to ensure it&apos;s connected to the correct product
   details, such as name, description, and price.

```ts
// types.ts

type CartItem = {
  id: number; // a new id to distinguish products with the same product id but different attributes
  size: Size;
  color: Color;
  quantity: number;
  product_id: number; // reference to the product's id for retrieving product data
};

type Cart = {
  items: CartItem[];
};
```

# Manipulating The State

Once the product and cart objects are properly set up, the next step is to
handle cart operations like adding items, updating attributes, and removing
items. Whether you're using Redux Toolkit, Zustand, or React's Context API, the
logic follows the same fundamental principles.

## Adding to Cart

When adding an item to the cart, first check whether an item with the same
product ID and attributes (like size and color) already exists. If it does,
simply increase the quantity. If not, create a new CartItem and append it to the
cart.

**Steps**:

1. Check if the product (with the selected attributes) is already in the cart.
2. If it exists, update the quantity.
3. If it doesn't exist, create a new cart item and add it to the state.

```ts
// actions.ts

function addToCart(state: Cart, newItem: CartItem): Cart {
  const existingItem = state.items.find(
    (item) =>
      item.product_id === newItem.product_id &&
      item.size === newItem.size &&
      item.color.hex === newItem.color.hex
  );

  if (existingItem) {
    return {
      ...state,
      items: state.items.map((item) =>
        item.id === existingItem.id
          ? { ...item, quantity: item.quantity + newItem.quantity }
          : item
      ),
    };
  } else {
    return {
      ...state,
      items: [...state.items, { ...newItem, id: Date.now() }], // Generates a new unique ID
    };
  }
}
```

## Updating the Cart

Sometimes users may want to update the quantity or attributes of an item in the
cart, such as changing the size or color. In this case, you'll need to find the
item, update its attributes or quantity. It&apos;s also crucial to review the
entire cart after making these changes to determine if any additional actions
are needed.

**Steps**:

1. Find the item by its unique ID.
2. Update the relevant attributes (size, color) or quantity.

```ts
// actions.ts

function updateCartItem(
  state: Cart,
  id: number,
  newAttributes: { size?: Size; color?: Color; quantity?: number }
): Cart {
  return {
    ...state,
    items: state.items.map((item) =>
      item.id === id ? { ...item, ...newAttributes } : item
    ),
  };
}
```

**EDGE CASE**: Let's say a user has the following two cart items in their cart.

```ts
const CartItem1 = {
  id: 1,
  size: "L",
  color: "Violet",
  quantity: 2,
  product_id: 58,
};

const CartItem2 = {
  id: 2,
  size: "M",
  color: "Violet",
  quantity: 1,
  product_id: 58,
};
```

What would happen if we were to update the size of **CartItem1** to "M"?

In the current implementation of the updateCartItem function, we would end up
with two separate cart items that have exactly the same properties except for
their id.

> **SOLUTION**: We need to create a reusable function that iterates through the
> cart items and checks for matches based on the product_id, size, and color
> fields. If matching items are found, their quantities should be consolidated
> into a single cart item. This function can be called at the end of the
> updateCartItem function.

```ts
// actions.ts

function consolidateCartItems(state: Cart): Cart {
  const consolidatedItems: CartItem[] = [];

  // Iterate over each cart item
  state.items.forEach((item) => {
    // Check if item already exists in consolidatedItems
    const existingItem = consolidatedItems.find(
      (i) =>
        i.product_id === item.product_id &&
        i.size === item.size &&
        i.color.hex === item.color.hex
    );

    if (existingItem) {
      // If found, update the quantity
      existingItem.quantity += item.quantity;
    } else {
      // If not found, add the new item to consolidatedItems
      consolidatedItems.push({ ...item });
    }
  });

  // Return the updated cart with consolidated items
  return {
    ...state,
    items: consolidatedItems,
  };
}
```

## Removing from the Cart

To remove an item, simply filter it out of the cart by its unique ID.

**Steps**:

1. Find the item in the cart by its unique ID.
2. Remove it from the cart state.

```ts
// actions.ts

function removeFromCart(state: Cart, itemId: number) {
  return {
    ...state,
    items: state.items.filter((item) => item.id !== itemId),
  };
}
```

---

## Calculating Total Price & Quantity

It's important to provide users with real-time updates on their cart&apos;s
total price and quantity. Whenever a change is made to the cart, call these
functions.

```ts
// actions.ts

function calculateTotalPrice(state: Cart, products: Product[]) {
  return state.items.reduce((total, item) => {
    const product = products.find((p) => p.id === item.product_id);
    return total + (product ? product.price * item.quantity : 0);
  }, 0);
}

function calculateTotalQuantity(state: Cart) {
  return state.items.reduce((total, item) => total + item.quantity, 0);
}
```

# Final Thoughts

By following these principles, you can build a flexible and user-friendly
shopping cart system for your e-commerce application. Remember to keep the user
experience in mind, ensuring that the cart is easy to use, intuitive, and
responsive to user actions. Whether you’re dealing with state management through
Redux, Zustand, or Context API, the fundamentals remain the same: make it clear,
concise, and reliable.
